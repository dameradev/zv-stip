### **Why a 30 minutes free Consultation?**

&nbsp;

**Understanding**

We firstly try to understand your goals, so we can determine what's the best way to complete your project.

&nbsp;

**Get to know each other**

Communication is important for creating a working relationship for the success of your project.

We use these 30 minutes to get to know you, and present ourselves to you.

&nbsp;

**Not a Sales Pitch**

The free consultation does not include a high-pressure sale. This is about determining what your business need and whether we can help you or not.

&nbsp;

**The goal is to create a proposal**

The goal is to collect enough information about your business to create a great proposal for you.
