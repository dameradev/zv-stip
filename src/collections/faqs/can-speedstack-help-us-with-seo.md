Yes this is one of our main competences, the choice of technology allows us to develop high ranking SEO sites. Other than the general principles of SEO, we strive to nail the less known principles for getting each web page to rank high, these include:

* **Mobile** **Usability**, with the rise of mobile browsing, this has become a significant ranking factor
* **Core web vitals**, these are: loading performance, UX, interactivity, etc.
* **Semantic html**, due to our sites being 100% hand coded, we have total control of the way we present your markup, unlike a lot of the page builders, which give you minimal control.

Along these principles, we will guide you on how you can write more SEOable content, we also provide this service using our partners.
