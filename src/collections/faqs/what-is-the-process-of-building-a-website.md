### Initial contact

Before we start, we offer a free consultation, on this meeting, we'll present to you our services, and get the initial evaluation, after this meeting you can decide if you're ready to go to the next step.

[Book a free consultation]()<br><br>Before this meeting we ask all our clients to fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1dtqeeshhtozp2vVflnWmww7c-LlSKrjvTTCrQVhJx3E/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">questionnaire</a>, so we can better prepare for your project.

&nbsp;

### Internal Process

We create an evaluation, and determine the tasks that need to be done in order to successfully finish the project.  <br><br>When this evaluation is done, we have a rough time-estimate for project completion.<br><br>Before we finalize the contract, you need to decide which pricing option fits you best

&nbsp;

### 2 price options

**For fixed projects**:

We determine a budget, create the project scope and wait for your confirmation

**For subscription:**

Based on the selected tier

You will either be priced at the tier’s monthly price with no upfront cost, or if you decide you need extras these will be charged before the start of the project, after that the monthly subscription will kick in.

See here the [benefits of subscription,](/subscriptions) and weather that’s the right fit for you.
